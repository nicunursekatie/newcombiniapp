# Comprehensive Task Management Web Application
        
Build me a web app like this: 
Core Features
1. Task Organization

Create and manage tasks with due dates
Organize tasks into hierarchical structures (tasks can have subtasks)
Mark tasks as complete/incomplete
Edit task details (title, due date, categories, project)

2. Projects & Categories

Group related tasks into projects
Categorize tasks with color-coded categories
Filter and view tasks by project or category
Manage projects and categories through dedicated screens

3. Planning Tools

"What now?" wizard that helps decide what to work on based on:

Available time
Energy level
Current blockers


Daily Planner for time-blocking your day
Calendar View to see tasks and events by day/week/month

4. Dashboard & Views

Dashboard with overviews of projects and upcoming tasks
All Tasks view for a complete task list
Projects view to see tasks grouped by project
Categories view to see tasks grouped by category

5. Data Management

Import/Export data functionality
Sample data for new users
Reset data option

How It Works
The app uses your browser's local storage to save your data, meaning everything stays on your device. The interface is organized into several main sections accessible from the top navigation:

Dashboard: Quick overview of your projects and upcoming tasks
All Tasks: Complete list of all tasks
Projects: Tasks organized by project
Categories: Tasks organized by category
Calendar: Calendar view of tasks with due dates
Daily Planner: Tool for time-blocking your day

The "What now?" button helps you decide what to work on when you're feeling stuck or overwhelmed, by asking about your available time, energy level, and current blockers.
In summary, this is a comprehensive task management tool designed to help organize your work and personal life, with special consideration for ADHD needs like visual organization, hierarchical task structures, and decision-making support.

Built with Combini.
